# Full-stack JavaScript Workshop pt. 1

This is the repo containing the code for the workshop. There are a few different branches with each stage of the workshop that you can checkout and inspect as you want. Enjoy! Any questions email me.

## Objective

We want to make an interactive map where we can add, remove, and clear infections to show how a virus is spreading.

We also want to make this reusable and therefore want to upload a map as a background to add the infections on top of.

Finally, we want to export this beautiful picture to share with our colleagues.

Hopefully this encompasses basics of front-end development with JavaScript *without* using a framework. To go further, I suggest using a framework.
